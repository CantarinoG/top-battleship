# Battleship

### Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic game "Battleship." Players position their fleet on a 10x10 grid and engage in a strategic battle to sink the enemy's ships before losing their own.

The game features five ships of varying sizes (5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 units), and the enemy's ships are placed randomly on the grid. The objective is to locate and destroy all enemy ships while keeping your own fleet intact.

### How to Play

1. Place your fleet on the 10x10 grid. Each ship has a unique size (5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 units).
2. Take turns firing at enemy positions to uncover and sink their ships.
3. The game ends when either:
   - All enemy ships are destroyed.
   - All your ships are destroyed.

### Features

- **Customizable Fleet Placement**: Put ships onto the grid to position your fleet.
- **Randomized Enemy Fleet**: The enemy's ships are placed randomly for a unique experience each time.
- **Real-Time Gameplay**: Turn-based mechanics with instant feedback on hits and misses.
- **Win/Loss Conditions**: Victory is achieved by sinking all enemy ships, while a loss occurs if all your ships are sunk.

### Enemy Actions

Currently, enemy actions are randomized, meaning the enemy selects its moves without strategic targeting. Therefore, there is potential for improvement, such as implementing a more advanced logic that targets known ship locations intelligently.
